## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>=16)
- MySQL database
- Prisma installed globally for database migrations
- Vercel account for deployment

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mydevify/MyHelpDesk.git
   cd MyHelpDesk
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Create a `.env` file and populate it with your credentials:
     - **Clerk API Keys** for authentication.
     - **Database credentials** for Prisma to manage MySQL.
   - Example `.env`:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=<Your Frontend API Key>
     CLERK_API_KEY=<Your Backend API Key>
     DATABASE_URL=mysql://<username>:<password>@<host>/<database_name>
     ```

4. **Database Setup**
   - Run the following command to set up the Prisma database:
     ```bash
     npx prisma migrate deploy
     npx prisma generate
     
     ```

Navigate to `public/DELETE_AFTER_SETUP/Insert_Tables_Info.sql`. Inside, you'll find the necessary data to populate your database, including role names, country names with their respective short codes, and bot account information. 

The bot account is used by the system to send an automated message when a user opens a ticket for the first time.

    To complete the setup:
    1. Copy the contents of this file.
    2. Paste it into the SQL terminal in phpMyAdmin.
    3. Execute the script, and you're all set!

5. **Run the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Deployment
The project is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**. Follow these steps:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
2. Import your environment variables into Vercel settings.
3. Deploy the app by triggering a build with the command:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage
Once deployed, users can:

- **Engage in real-time chat** with support staff.
